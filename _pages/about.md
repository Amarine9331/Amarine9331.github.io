👋🏼 Hello there!  
My name is **David A. Marinelarena**, and I am a biologist and computational life sciences researcher.  

I am currently a **Graduate Student at Arizona State University (ASU)** pursuing a Master’s in *Computational Life Sciences*.  
I also work as a **Graduate Researcher in the Qiyun Lab** at the ASU Biodesign Institute’s *Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics*.  

My research sits at the intersection of **genomics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning**.  
I focus on developing and applying computational methods to analyze complex **multi-omics datasets** (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics).

## 🔬 Research Interests

**Multi-Omics and Systems Biology**  
- Integrating genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics to understand microbial ecology and host–microbe interactions.  
- Placental and soil microbiome research, with emphasis on long-read sequencing technologies.  

**Computational Biology & Bioinformatics**  
- Development of scalable pipelines for metagenomics, transcriptomics, and phylogenetic placement.  
- Applications of **machine learning** and **graph models** in microbiome and multi-omics data.  

**Algorithmic Biology**  
- Exploring efficient algorithms for assembly graph construction, phylogenetic tree inference, and sequence placement.

## 📂 Projects

- **Placental Transcriptomics Database (GEO)** — Created a curated resource for placental gene expression analysis.  
- **Soil Metagenomics (PNNL collaboration)** — Re-analyzed Birch effect wetting/drying experiments with machine learning and bioinformatics pipelines.  
- **Fragment Insertion Algorithm Prototype** — Designed a long-read optimized placement algorithm inspired by SEPP, integrating HMM-based methods and RAxML updates.  
- **Birthday Attack K-mer Filtering** — Built a prototype assembler comparing hash-collision–based k-mer reduction with standard de Bruijn graph assembly.  
- **Multi-Omics CURE Initiative** — Helped design a computational biology course module for integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics.
