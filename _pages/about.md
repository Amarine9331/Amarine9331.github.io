👋🏼 Hello there!  
My name is **David A. Marinelarena**, and I am a **Computational Biologist and Biotechnology Professional**.  

I am currently a **Graduate Student at Arizona State University (ASU)** pursuing a Master’s in *Computational Life Sciences*.

My research sits at the intersection of **genomics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning** 🧬

I Mainly focus on developing and applying computational methods to analyze complex multi-omics datasets. 
This entails leveraging the entire multiome to build a more complete portrait of biological systems.  

I aim to continue building computational tools and conducting research that benefits both scientists and patients.
