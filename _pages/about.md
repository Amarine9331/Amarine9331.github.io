üëãüèº Hello there. My Name is David A. Marinelarena and I am a Biolgist.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
Currently, I am working as a Research Scientist at Sakana AI exploring how to develop an openended algorithm to coevolve a population of agents and the environment they are in.
Before this, I explored latent reasoning by combining diffusion models with large language models and how to train a process reward model for training multimodal large language models as UI-Agents.

During my final year at college I was working as a Student Researcher at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on Generative Video-Language Modelling.

Additionally, I have professional experience working as an Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.
