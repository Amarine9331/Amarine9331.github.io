👋🏼 Hello there!  
My name is **David A. Marinelarena**, and I am a biologist and computational life sciences researcher.  

I am currently a **Graduate Student at Arizona State University (ASU)** pursuing a Master’s in *Computational Life Sciences*.  
  

My research sits at the intersection of **genomics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning**.  🧬👨🏻‍💻
I focus on developing and applying computational methods to analyze complex **multi-omics datasets** (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics). What this entails means using not just gentic or chemichal information to understand a Biolgical system or process but leveraging the entire multiome to build a more complete portrait of the underlying Biolgy. 


I hope to continue building Computational Tools and providing research that helps both researchers and patients.
